## Opions

you can change `--show-github-link: block;` to `--show-github-link: none;` to hide the link thingy yk at the header

can change the durations and delays of the title animation (the one that happens at the start) by changing these numbers at the top of the file
make sure you dont forget the `;` HEHHE HA
```css
--title-screen-delay: 500ms;
--title-screen-duration: 1200ms;
--title-text-duration: 900ms;
  ```
